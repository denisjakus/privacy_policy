Privacy Policy for Last Text Bookmark
Effective date: 2026-02-25

Last Text Bookmark (“the extension”) is a browser extension that lets users bookmark selected text on webpages and return to that exact reading position later.

1) Summary

The extension stores bookmark data locally in the user’s browser.
The extension does not send user data to external servers.
The extension does not sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties.
The extension does not use analytics, advertising trackers, or remote code.

2) Data the extension processes

To provide bookmarking functionality, the extension processes and stores:

Page URL (used to map a bookmark to a page)
User-selected text snippet
Position/context metadata needed to relocate the text later (for example text offset and nearby context)
Timestamp of bookmark creation/update

3) Where data is stored

All bookmark data is stored locally on the user’s device using browser extension local storage. Data remains under the user’s browser profile unless the user clears it.

4) Data sharing and transfer

No user data is sold.
No user data is transferred to third parties.
No user data is used for purposes unrelated to the extension’s single purpose.
No user data is used or transferred for creditworthiness or lending decisions.

5) Remote code and network use
The extension does not load or execute remote code. All code is packaged with the extension. The extension does not make external network requests for data collection.

6) Permissions used

storage: to save bookmarks locally so they persist across reloads/restarts.
activeTab: to run user-initiated actions from the popup on the current tab.
Host access to webpages: required so bookmarking works on pages users visit.

7) User control
Users can:

Replace a bookmark by selecting new text on the same page.
Clear a bookmark from the popup.
Clear all bookmarks from the popup.
Remove the extension at any time.

8) Children’s privacy
The extension is not directed to children and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

9) Changes to this policy
This policy may be updated from time to time. The latest version will be posted at the same Privacy Policy URL.
